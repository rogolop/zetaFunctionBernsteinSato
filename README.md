# zetaFunctionBernsteinSato
Implementation in Magma of an algorithm to calculate the stratification of the roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of irreducible plane curve singularities along deformations with constant Milnor number.

This code uses the library for plane curve singularities [SingularitiesDim2](https://github.com/gblanco92/SingularitiesDim2) by Guillem Blanco.

The code might be subject to corrections and/or improvements in the near future. 

An article explaining the mathematical results in which the code is based should be eventually published. The calculations find the zeroes of the poles of the complex zeta function.
