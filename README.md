# zetaFunctionBernsteinSato
Algorithm for the stratification of the roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial along irreducible plane curve singularity deformations, in Magma.

It uses the library for plane curve singularities SingularitiesDim2 (https://github.com/gblanco92/SingularitiesDim2) by Guillem Blanco.

The code might be subject to minor corrections and/or improvements in the near future. An article explaining the mathematical results in which the code is based should be eventually published.
